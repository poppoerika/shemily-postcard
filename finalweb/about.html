		<h2>About Shemily's Postcard</h2>
		<p>Shemily's Postcard was created by an older sister Erika Tharp and a younger sister Emily Nakagawa in 2017. Erika creates an organized and accessible website for Shemily's Postcard. And, Emily designs all of the postcards which are sold on the website. The name "Shemily" came from their loved German Shepherd, Shelly, who died because of skin cancer 3 years ago and Emily who is a designer of Shemily's Postcard put together. Emily was quite sad about Shelly's death, so Erika told her to make something reminds her of happy days with Shelly. Since Emily has been wanting to be a designer, she dicided to draw different kinds of pictures. One day, Erika asked Emily if she can sell them online as Shemily's Postcard. Since then, the sisters have been very busy maintaining and creating both website and postcards everyday. Our goal is to spread happiness and love through the postcards as Shelly did for us.</p>
